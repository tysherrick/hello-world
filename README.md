# hello-world

Hello,

I recently quit my job repairing computers for Staples recently. I quit to start my own computer repair business, and so far it has been quite lucrative. I had some coding classes in college but have forgotten most of what I learned. Hence, I wound up here learning how to code from scratch agaain.
